# This weblog is a web application developed by Ruby on Rails framework.
# This is based on the book 'Ruby on Rails Tutorial 4th edition', written by Michael Hartl.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
```
$ rails server
```
